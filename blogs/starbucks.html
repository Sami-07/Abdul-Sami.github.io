                    show towards the environmental safety. <br>
                    &#x2022; On July 9, 2018, Starbucks President and CEO **Kevin Johnson** announced that Starbucks
                    will ban

                    single-use plastic straws by January 1, 2020, on all cold

                    or
                    compostable plastic, while other cold drinks will get straw-less lids. south Korea is the first
                    country to
                    introduce paper straws to all stores among 78 countries in the world that Starbucks has entered.

                    &#x2022; Starbucks has publicly committed to reducing waste by 50% by 2030.After successfully
                    completing the
                    campaign to provide the Reusable Cup in Vietnam in 2020, it held the same event in Korea in 2021.
                    Along with
                    a picture of throwing away a cleanly washed recycled PET bottle on Instagram,
                    a hashtag designated by Starbucks was written and uploaded, and a
                    reusable cup was provided instead of a disposable cup. <br>
                    &#x2022; In April 2013, Starbucks introduced reusable cups where customers would be able to bring
                    their cup
                    into
                    any location and receive a small discount on their drink. When
                    the COVID-19 pandemic first began in 2019, the company halted the
                    use of personal cups due to concerns with the transferring of germs. <br>
                    &#x2022; Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award in 2005 for using
                    10% recycled
                    paper in its beverage cups in 2006—the company claimed that
                    the initiative was the first time that recycled material had been used in a product that came into
                    direct
                    contact with a food or beverage.

                    these companies are so simple but attractive. and so is the StarBucks logo.
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; In 2006, Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a
                    "twin-tailed
                    mermaid, or siren mythology as she's known in Greek
                    mythology."There has been a lot of changes in the logo since it was created. <br>In the first
                    version, the
                    Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough
                    visual
                    texture.Starbucks says the image is based on a 16th-century
                    "Norse" woodcut, although
                    other scholars note that it is apparently based on a 15th-century woodcut in Juan Eduardo
                    Cirlot's *Dictionary of Symbols*. Then, the second
                    version of the StarBucks logo lasted from 1987 to 1992 in which her breasts were covered by her
                    flowing
                    hair, but her navel was still visible. The fish tail was cropped slightly, and the primary color was
                    changed
                    from brown to green, a nod to the Alma Mater of the three founders, the University of San
                    Francisco.In the third version, used between
                    1992 and 2011, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish
                    tails.

            <div class="sec">
                <div class="subtxt">At the beginning of September 2006, and then again in early 2008, Starbucks
                    temporarily reintroduced
                    its
                    original brown logo on paper hot-drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show
                    the
                    company's
                    heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo
                    sparked
                    some
                    controversy due in part to the siren's bare
                    breasts, but the temporary switch garnered
                    little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when it reintroduced
                    the
                    vintage logo
                    in 2006. The logo was altered when Starbucks
                    entered the Saudi Arabian market in 2000 to remove the siren, leaving only her
                    crown, as reported in a Pulitzer
                    Prize-winning column by Colbert I.
                    King in The Washington
                    Post in 2002. The company announced three months later
                    that it would be using the international logo in Saudi
                    Arabia. In January 2011, Starbucks announced
                    that it would make small changes to the company's logo, removing the Starbucks wordmark
                    around the
                    siren,
                    enlarging the siren image, and making it green.

                    through <br>
                    a food collection service named Food Donation
                    Connection.
                     In March 2016, Starbucks unveiled a five-year plan to donate 100 percent of unsold food from its
                    7,600
                    company-operated stores in the U.S. to local food banks and
                    pantries.
                     Perishable food will be transported in refrigerated trucks to area food banks through the company's
                    partnerships with the Food Donation Connection
                     and Feeding America
                    . This program, called FoodShare, is expected to provide up to 50 million meals over the next five
                    years.
                     As of 2017, the program was in 10 different markets, including New York
                    City.
                     In New York, Starbucks works with Feeding America and City Harvest, both non-profits, to donate
                    food from
                    45 locations. It plans to expand the program to all 305 Manhattan stores. In September 2019, 60% of
                    Starbucks stores are participating in FoodShare. This level of participation contributed to 20
                    million meals
                    served to those in need.
