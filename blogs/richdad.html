            <br> Rich Dad Poor Dad.
        </h1>
        <div class="txt">
            &#x2022; Key points of Rich dad poor dad
            <br>
            &#x2022; It’s completely based on what was helpful for me peronally and would also be beneficial for you as
            well.
            <br>
            &#x2022; In this Book, Robert Kiyosaki, refers to his two dads namely Rich dad and poor dad.
            <br>
            &#x2022; he refers his own father as a poor dad and rich dad to his friend’s dad.
            <br>
            &#x2022; The Poor dad completed his education and had a Ph.D. and got many degrees . and worked as a
            professional

            Teacher. The Rich dad never finished his eighth standard.
            <br>
            &#x2022; I will be sharing my learnings from Rich dad and his advices to Robert and Mike(robert’s friend)
            <br>
            <h2 class="sub-title"> 1. Knowledge is Power. </h2>
            <div class="sec">

                <div class="subtxt">
                    &#x2022; If you have a lot of money but do not have any financial knowledge like taxes ,

                    investing, etc , you would be in a great loss.

                    even Cardi B , a famous singer regrets not taking any financial classes when she was young. and now
                    ,
                    she
                    has to pay huge money to other people to manage her money.

                    <br>



                    &#x2022; He said, “It is not gambling if you know what you are doing. It is gambling if you are just
                    throwing
                    money
                    into a deal or praying.”
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; when you have knowledge for investing, you will do well. and knowledge doesn’t just come
                    from
                    reading
                    some
                    book like Rich dad Poor dad. knowledge comes with real life executions.

            </div>
            <h2 class="sub-title">2. You will learn by making mistakes.</h2>
            <div class="sec">
                <div class="subtxt">
                    &#x2022; you might loose money initially in stock market, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll
                    always keep loosing .
                    with every failure , you gain experience.
                    Every successfull person you see today have failed in their life many times. But despite their
                    failures, they didn't give up. They kept on trying and finally, after a lot of efforts, they became
                    what they are today.  
                <br>
                &#x2022; Early Success is a Scam. Great things take time.
                <br> 
                    &#x2022; Failure is a part of Success . People who avoid faikure
                    also avoid
                    Success.
                    <br>


                    &#x2022; He mentions, “There is always risk in evrything, so learn to manage risk and learn from it
                    instead
                    of
                    avoiding it.

            </div>
            <h2 class="sub-title"> 3. If you hate risk and worry, start early.</h2>
            <div class="sec">

                <div class="subtxt">
                    - He says “If you start young, it’s easier to be rich.”
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; It’s Okay to be fearful. One way to overcome that is to start early and allow the power of
                    compound
                    interest work for you!
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; Even Ankur warikoo agrees with this statement. he said , “ if you start investing into
                    stock
                    market at the
                    age 20, starting with just 500rs per month and increasing the amount by 10% every year then in 20
                    years you
                    will have 13L. in 30 years , it will become 75L.and in 40 years, it will become 3.5Cr.
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; it’s not the amount you start with but the consistancy you maintain through out your
                    investing
                    journey.

            </div>
            <h2 class="sub-title">4. Do not Specialize yourself in a particular domain.</h2>
            <div class="sec">
                <div class="subtxt">
                    &#x2022; Robert’s poor dad wanted him to become specialized like him in a particular domain even
                    though
                    that didn’t
                    work out well in his own life. Robert believes the more specialized you become , the more you are
                    trapped
                    and dependent on that specialty. The world is evolving and you must be adaptive to the innovations
                    happening
                    around the world. and if you don’t you will be left behind.
<br>
                    &#x2022; Robert says, Learning skiils outsiide what you think of as your profession will benefit
                    you.

            </div>

            <h2 class="sub-title"> 5. The way you think affects your actions.</h2>
            <div class="sec">

                <div class="subtxt">
                    &#x2022; Rich dad believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut down your brain. But “How can I
                    afford
                    it?”
                    opens up possibilities , excitement, and dreams.
                    <br>
                    &#x2022; This doesn’t just apply at financial level but also your behaviour. Extracting something
                    good from a
                    bad
                    thing is something which will change the way you think about the world. being positive always calms
                    your
                    mind and opens up your mind to think of all the possibilities to get out of that bad situation.

            <br>
